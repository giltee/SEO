## Google cares about how good other people think your content is

## What are backlinks
- A signal to Google that your site is a high-quality resource that people want to reference.
- More backlinks + higher quality backlinks = higher ranking
- In general, webmasters can improve the rank of their sites by increasing the number of high-quality sites that link to their pages.

## Link building 
- The process of manually encouraging people to link to your website from theirs
- People are more likely to link to content pages vs product pages
- The key to effective link building is to complement creating great content with manually building links.

## How many links does it need to rank on Page 1
- To rank highly you need as many links as the other ranked results with the same search query / keywords

## How to calculate a baseline target for how many links you'll need:
1. Choose a broad topic that you want to be known for.
2. Plug the topic into Google and run a search
3. Run the URLs for the top 10 results through a link-checking tool.
4. Calculate the average number of root domains linking to these sites. 

## Link checking tool
- Moz Link Explorer tells you how many root domains link to that URL

## Don't try to be different 
- Do not try and stand out in search by creating a piece of content that's really different and unique
- Does your website already have a piece of content that contains those common themes and elements?
- If not, your first step will be to create a new piece of content that has a similar structure and feel to the results on page one.
