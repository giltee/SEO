# On-page SEO
- Important for both search engines and people
- Most basic signal that information is relevant is when a webpage contains the same keywords as your search query
- If those keywords appear on the page, or if they appear in the headings or body of the text, the information is more likely to be relevant. 
- You need to be selective with the keywords you use

# Heading, title, external links
- Heading tags do not directly impact SEO, but they indirectly are effected by bounce rates
- Your page title should have an H1 tag
- Subsequent headings on the page should have an H2 or H3 tag, and so on.
- Use your primary keyword in your page title
- h1 should be your page heading, and below h2 / h3 for additional sections
- Heading should match your content in descriptive way
- Title tags and main heading tags can be the same, but sometimes there are reasons for separate tags:

# Best practices for title tags
- Include your primary keyword in your title tag
- Keep your title under 60 characters, if possible
- Make sure both your page heading and title answer the searches primary question
- The most important part of creating SEO friendly content, is creating user-friendly content.
