# Internal Link 
- Any link goes from one page on the current site to another page on the same site.
- Internal links pass authority from one page to another.

# Website Architecture 
- Think of it as a pyramid with most important content at the top and least important content at the bottom.

# Audit your sites internal links
- You can use a tool like Ahrefs Site Audit to scan your website for linking that need fixing and find any orphan pages that no other pages link to.
