## What are keywords
- The words and phrases that people type into search engines.
- Keyword research is the finding and analyzing search terms that people enter into search engines with the goal of using that data for a specific purpose. 

## Keyword Research helps you answer questions like:
- What are people searching for?
- How many people are searching for it?
- What format do they want to receive information in?
- How difficult will it be to rank for that search query?

## What are head terms?
- Head terms (or fat head) are usually single-word keywords with lots of search volume and competition (e.g. marketing, insurance)

## What is search volume
- The number of times that a particular keyword is entered into a search engine per month.

## What are body keywords?
- Chunky middle (or body keywords) are 2-3 word phrases with decent search volume, but slightly more specific than head terms and with slightly less competition (e.g. Marketing automation, car insurance).

## What are long tail keywords?
- More specific phrases that don't get as much search volume but tend to be less competitive.
- Long tail keywords make up the majority of searches online.
- The long tail refers to the long tail of the distribution.
- Long tail examples:
    - How to apply sunscreen
    - How often should you apply sunscreen
    - When to apply sunscreen
    - Best sunscreen ingredients
    - Best natural sunscreen for kids
