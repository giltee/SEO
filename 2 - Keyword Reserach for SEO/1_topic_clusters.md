- The targeting clusters lead to a "Pillar Page", a website page that covers a topic and is linked to a cluster of related content. 

# Topic cluster model
- Pillar page
- Subtopic
- Hyperlink
- Topic clusters rearrange site architecture to clusters of related content that link to a central pillar page.
- Each pillar page should provide a comprehensive overview of the topic you're writing about
