# Google Search Console
- Connect your site to google search console by adding a txt record or cname record with your hosting provider
- The Performance tab holds the most important data:
    - *Total clicks*: is how many times a user clicked through to your site. How this is counted depends on the search result type. 
    - *Total impressions*: is how many times a user saw a link to your site in search results. This is calculated differently for images and other search result types, depending on whether or not the result was scrolled into view.
    - *Average CTR*: is the percentage of impressions that resulted in a click.
    - *Average position*: is the average position of your site in search results, based on its highest position whenever it appeared in a search. Individual page position is available in the table below the chart. Position determination can be complicated by features such as carousels or Knowledge Panels.
